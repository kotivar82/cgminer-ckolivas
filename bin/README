Bitmain AntMiner S1 binary cross compiled with the OpenWrt toolchain.

Sourced from:
     https://github.com/nicehash/cgminer-ckolivas

S1 driver sourced from:
     https://github.com/kanoi/cgminer -b ants1-4.3.2a-85fcf0c
as:
     driver-bitmain-s1a.c, driver-bitmain-s1a.h

Replaced api version 3.5 with api version 3.3 so S1 web interface Miner Status
page works.


cgminer:

Drop in replacement for /usr/bin/cgminer

With extranonce.subscribe as used with nicehash.com & westhash.com



cgminer-solo:

Enabled curses and curl. It is possible to solo mine directly from the S1
as long as it is properly re-configured manually!!!

You will need to install libcurl, libncurses and libpolarssl for this binary to
function.

With the most recent Bitmain S1 image Check /etc/opkg.conf line:
src/gz barrier_breaker

make sure it is:
http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/packages/base

Then issue:
# opkg update
# opkg install libcurl
# opkg install libncurses
# opkg install libpolarssl

THIS IS BETA TEST CODE! NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE!
