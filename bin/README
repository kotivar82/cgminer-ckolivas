Bitmain AntMiner S1 binary cross compiled with the OpenWrt toolchain.

Sourced from: https://github.com/nicehash/cgminer-ckolivas

Replaced api version 3.5 with api version 3.3 so S1 web interface Miner Status
page works.

With extranonce.subscribe used with nicehash.com & westhash.com

Enable curses and curl. It is possible to solo mine directly from the S1
as long as it is properly re-configured manually.


Drop in replacement for /usr/bin/cgminer

THIS IS BETA TEST CODE! NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE!
